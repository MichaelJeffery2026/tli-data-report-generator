### Use of Generative AI

The report was created by the **Teaching and Learning Innovation Team** at Mays Business School using **ChatGPT** through tamu.chat.ai. As an initial step, we employed generative AI tools to identify potential trends, themes, and insights from the survey data. The Learning Design Team carefully reviewed, validated, and refined the AI-generated observations to ensure accuracy and relevance. The final report provides actionable insights for course improvements.
