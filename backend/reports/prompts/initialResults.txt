For the Results section, analyze each survey question one at a time. Write exactly one concise paragraph per question in a professional, faculty-facing tone. Do not simply restate the raw numbers, since charts are provided in the report. Instead, highlight meaningful patterns, trends, and implications for student experience. Recognize that not all questions carry equal weight: some require deeper conclusions, while others may be addressed factually and briefly depending on the weight of the question. Any calculations must be mathematically accurate. Focus on insights that help faculty and department heads understand how students experienced the course.
