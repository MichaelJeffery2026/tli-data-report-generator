Using the Course Design Summary and Results sections below, write no more than 4 actionable recommendations for the faculty member who will teach this course again. 

Each recommendation should:
- Be 1-2 sentences long,
- Be specific about what action to take,
- Explicitly connect to findings from the Results or Course Design,
- Be written in a professional, faculty-facing tone.

Do not create sub-bullets or expand each recommendation into multiple ideas. Output should be a simple list of distinct recommendations, each on its own line.
