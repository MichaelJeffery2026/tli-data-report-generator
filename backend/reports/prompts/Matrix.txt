The text of this question is: "{{{text}}}"

This is a Likert-scale question with {{{count}}} student responses. Students rated sixteen statements on a scale from 1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly Agree”). Below are the average scores and standard deviations for each item:

{{#responses}}
- "{{{option}}}" — Average: {{{mean}}}, Standard Deviation: {{{stdev}}}
{{/responses}}

Write 4-6 paragraphs total, grouped by category, rather than treating each item individually:
1. High-consensus strengths (high mean, low standard deviation).
2. High-consensus weaknesses (low mean, low standard deviation).
3. Mixed areas (average mean, wider standard deviation).
4. Outliers (statements with unusually high variability).
5. Synthesis and conclusions that integrate the findings into a broader interpretation of the student experience.

Do not restate every number. Instead, group statements into these categories, highlight patterns, and explain implications for course design and student engagement.
